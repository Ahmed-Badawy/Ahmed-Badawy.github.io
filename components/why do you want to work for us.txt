I really believe in the value of teamwork and so when I saw a position with your company to join your engineering department I had to make sure my application was put in.  I believe strongly in working with other people towards a common goal and I know the skills I bring not only as a programmer, but as a team member will not only bring me work satisfaction, but will make me a valuable teammate as well
